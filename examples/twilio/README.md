## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have:
- A Neuphonic API Key
- A Twilio account with a Twilio phone number
- Python 3.9 or higher
- A free [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account with the ngrok CLI installed and authenticated

## Setup
### Environment Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Add the following variables to your `.env` file:
   - `NEUPHONIC_API_KEY`: Found on the [Neuphonic portal](https://app.neuphonic.com/)
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` and `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Available in your Twilio portal
   - `FROM_NUMBER`: Your Twilio-purchased phone number
   - `TO_NUMBER`: Your personal phone number for receiving test calls
   
   Leave `SERVER_BASE_URL` blank for now - we'll fill this in the next step.

### Running the Server
The server, built with FastAPI, handles communication between Twilio and Neuphonic. Here's how to get it running:

1. Start ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http http://localhost:8000
   ```
   
   Copy the displayed URL (excluding the `https://` prefix) and add it to your `.env` file as `SERVER_BASE_URL`. It will look something like `123d-45-678-912-3.ngrok-free.app`.

   <details>
   <summary>About ngrok</summary>
   ngrok securely exposes your local machine's port 8000 to the internet, providing a public URL that Twilio can use to communicate with your server. This is necessary because Twilio needs a secure, publicly accessible endpoint to interact with your application.

2. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Initiate an Outbound Call
To test the integration, you can initiate an outbound call from your Twilio number to your personal phone number:
```bash
python make_outbound_call.py
```
